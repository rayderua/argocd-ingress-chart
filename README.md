# ArgoCD Ingress Helm Chart

This Helm chart is a lightweight derivative of the official [ArgoCD chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/argo/argo-cd),  
tailored specifically for deploying only the **Ingress resources**.  
It simplifies installation by removing all non-essential components while preserving compatibility with the original chart.

## Key Features
- üöÄ Deploys only Ingress resources for ArgoCD
- üß© Simplified chart based on the official ArgoCD Helm chart
- ‚öôÔ∏è Default `fullnameOverride` is set to **`argocd`**, matching the default service name in the official chart

helm repo add argocd-ingress https://rayderua.github.io/argocd-ingress-chart
helm repo update
helm install argocd-ingress argocd-ingress/argocd-ingress
```
